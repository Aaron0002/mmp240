                <h3>Queensborough Community College </h3>
                    <h2>Digital Art and Design</h2>
                    <h4>Degree: A.S. </h4>
                
<p> The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry. </p>

<p>Digital Art and Design students should take ARTS-192 and ET-710 as Writing Intensive course requirements.</p>

<p>Specifically, the program provides students with:</p>
        <p>-knowledge of current widely used programs in the design field</p>
        <p>-proficiency in operating these programs</p>
        <p>-understanding of the means and methods of mass (production of artwork using these programs)</p>
        <p>-skills for working with and understanding the computer and the technical problems associated with operating a computer</p>
        <p>-knowledge based on awareness of the importance of aesthetic judgment in making design decisions.</p>
